<h1> Chatting Rules </h1> 

1. Ask your question in the first message. <br> <br>
2. I don't have time to help you with your problem. Please use <a href = "http://google.com">google.com</a> to solve it. <br> <br>
3. If you need help with my discord server: Please use the ticket system. My supporter is always there to help you. <br> <br>
4. If you are looking for something specific: Please don't ask me if I know where you can get it. <br> <br>
5. Please be respectful with my time <br> <br> <br> <br>

If you are not follwing these rules you won't get any response <br>
These rules are there to save my time. Many people are messaging me every day and my time is limited. <br> <br>
I hope you understand me.
